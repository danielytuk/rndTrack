We use various Spotify playlists *"sources"*, to assist with providing random tracks on our site.

The reasoning for using these sources, is it's hard to keep track with various labels, distributors, and or new artists.

If you'd like your tracks added, please submit a pull request or issue with a playlist containing your songs.
